## What is it?

This node-based app aims to simplify the decision-making process League of Legends players face when navigating the 160+ playable characters the game offers. LoL Recommender's takes its users' current 'vibe' and matches it with a champion that matches that vibe.

By leveraging the OpenAI API, LoL Recommender is able to parse complex and unstructured input and match it with the best possible fit.

LoL Recommender allows users to:
* Create an account.
* Provide input about their current vibe.
* Get a champion recommendation based on their input.
* Get details about the recommended champion directly from the Riot Games API.
* Access their user profile for the app.
* Modify the name associated with their account.
* Delete their user account.
* Access a record of their recommendations and the prompts associated with them.

This page displays each user's information, provides them with the tools to edit or delete their account and displays all of the recommendations they have generated and their associated information.

#### App
![App Page](https://github.com/soyrvelez/lol-champ-recommender/blob/main/resources/app.png?sanitize=true)
